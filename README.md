Munge - Feed Me
===============
Munge is a simple, no-frills RSS/Atom Feedreader webapp. It does what a Feed reader should do: aggregate feeds from
various sources and display them in a variety of manners. It's written in Modern Perl, using Dancer as it's framework, and hosted on
dotclouds's sandbox http://munge-mvhenten.dotcloud.com ( Send me an e-mail if you want to try ).

Motivation
----------
I rely on feeds for most of my news and updates. I love Feedly.com's elegant interface, but nothing in this world comes for free.
Feedly, Google and others collect information about my habits and interests online, and I feel I am giving it away too easily.
My interests and habits are my own, and not a commodity to be traded by others.
Most companies use their data in a discrete manner, and most company have agreable privacy statements.
However, even if I **might trust your company**, I will not *trust your buyer*.

Runner up: watch this space for my Gmail Killer.

Installation
------------
I've got it all setup for running on dotcloud, checkout the `deploy.sh` file in the dotcloud directory.

Screenshot
----------
A picture says it all right.
